# Reflection 

1. I used my knowledge and skills I leanrd from this course and pervious course to create this web porfolio. The biggest challange I faced was translating my mockup to the web. I overcame it by making minor adjustments and keeping things simplistic. 


2. I kept the overall design simple to avoid clusters on each page. In the future I hope to add java to spice up my website, 


3. I learned that creating a web portfolio takes time and patience. Lots and lots of trial and error mixed with improvising and adjustments along the way.
